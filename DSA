Data Structure : is used to store and organize data . where we can accessed and updated efficiently .
Types of data structures :
    Linear Data Structure :
           elements are arraged in a order one after another . and it is easy to implement .
            popular linear data structures:
                       Arrays:
                             Same type of elements are arraged in one after another for fixed size
                             java syntax:
                                int [] arr=new int[5];
                                arr[0]=2;
                                arr[1]=2;
                                arr[2]=2;
                                arr[3]=2;
                                arr[4]=2;
                                //size will "arr.length" method
                                // access value with index poion like " arr[index]"
                                // copy arrays 
                                int[] arrcopy=new int[5];
                                arrcopy=arr;
                                
                       Stacks:
                          stack is data strucutre , elements are stored in LIFo principle, last added element will remove first 
                          
                       Queue :
                        Queue is unlike to stack
    Non-Linear Data Structure:
