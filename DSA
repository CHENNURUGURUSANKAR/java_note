Data Structure : is used to store and organize data . where we can accessed and updated efficiently .
Types of data structures :
    Linear Data Structure :
           elements are arraged in a order one after another . and it is easy to implement .
            popular linear data structures:
                       Arrays:
                             Same type of elements are arraged in one after another for fixed size
                             java syntax:
                                int [] arr=new int[5];
                                arr[0]=2;
                                arr[1]=2;
                                arr[2]=2;
                                arr[3]=2;
                                arr[4]=2;
                                //size will "arr.length" method
                                // access value with index poion like " arr[index]"
                                // copy arrays 
                                int[] arrcopy=new int[5];
                                arrcopy=arr;
                                
                       Stacks:
                          stack is data strucutre , elements are stored in LIFo principle, last added element will remove first 
                            few Method for stack :
                                    Push(): it is  used to add element in the last index/node
                                    Pop(): it is used remove last element 
                                    IsEmpty(): it is used to check weither thae stack is empty or not // we use tis method to while removing the element 
                                    IsFull(): it is used to check weither the stack is full or not // we will this while adding a element to stack 
                                    Peek(): it is used get top / last elemrnt from stack with put removing the element
                                    
                       Queue :
                        Queue is unlike to stack it will FIFO priciple 
                        few method for Queue:
                                Enqueue(): Enqueue() is to add element to top/ last index
                                Dequeue(): Dequeue is to remove first element 
                                IsFull():
                                IsEmpty():
                                Peek():
